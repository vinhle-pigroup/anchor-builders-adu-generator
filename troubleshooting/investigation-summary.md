# Additional Services Section Investigation - COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS

## INVESTIGATION STATUS: CRITICAL FINDINGS

### CORE DISCOVERY:
The Additional Services section **IS BEING GENERATED CORRECTLY** in the HTML output.

### EVIDENCE:
Generated HTML file: `/home/vinh/code/PiGroup-App/Anchor-Builders-ADU-Proposal-1754460677796.html`
Lines 850-864 show:
```html
<\!-- Additional Services Section -->
<tr>
  <td colspan="3" class="phase-header" style="background: #fef3c7; color: #92400e;">Additional Services</td>
</tr>
<tr class="milestone-row additional-service">
  <td class="milestone-number">A3</td>
  <td>Extra Bathroom - Additional bathroom beyond standard configuration</td>
  <td class="cost-value">$8,000</td>
</tr>
<tr class="milestone-row additional-service">
  <td class="milestone-number">A4</td>
  <td>Dedicated Driveway - Dedicated driveway and parking space</td>
  <td class="cost-value">$5,000</td>
</tr>
```

### STYLING DISCREPANCY FOUND:
**Template has:**
```html
<td colspan="3" class="phase-header construction-header">Phase 3: Additional Services</td>
```

**Generated HTML has:**
```html
<td colspan="3" class="phase-header" style="background: #fef3c7; color: #92400e;">Additional Services</td>
```

**Differences:**
1. Missing `construction-header` class
2. Inline styles instead of CSS class
3. Different text ("Additional Services" vs "Phase 3: Additional Services")
4. Different colors (yellow vs blue)

### ROOT CAUSE HYPOTHESIS:
The template replacement logic is working correctly, but:
1. **Template Content Issue**: The wrong template content may be replacing the header
2. **CSS Class Issue**: The `construction-header` class may not be applying correctly
3. **Visual Display Issue**: The section may be visually hidden due to CSS conflicts
4. **User Expectation Mismatch**: User may be looking for different styling/positioning

### INVESTIGATION STATUS:
✅ **CONFIRMED**: Additional Services section is being generated
✅ **CONFIRMED**: Template conditional logic is working (`ADD_ON_WORK_EXISTS = true`)
✅ **CONFIRMED**: Add-on items are being populated correctly
❓ **UNCONFIRMED**: Why styling differs from template
❓ **UNCONFIRMED**: Whether section is visually visible to user

### NEXT STEPS:
1. **Browser Testing**: Open generated HTML file in browser to confirm visual appearance
2. **CSS Investigation**: Check why `construction-header` class styling is not applied
3. **Template Validation**: Confirm which template is actually being used
4. **User Feedback**: Get specific user feedback on what they expect vs what they see

### RECOMMENDED FIX:
If the issue is styling-related, restore the correct CSS classes:
```html
<td colspan="3" class="phase-header construction-header">Phase 3: Additional Services</td>
```
Instead of:
```html
<td colspan="3" class="phase-header" style="background: #fef3c7; color: #92400e;">Additional Services</td>
```
