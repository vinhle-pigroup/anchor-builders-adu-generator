## üîç COMPARISON WITH CURRENT TEMPLATES

### **CRITICAL DISCREPANCIES FOUND**:

#### 1. **EXCLUSIONS Section - COMPLETELY WRONG**
**Historical (Proven):**
```
‚Ä¢ City permits, planning approval fees, and third-party inspections
‚Ä¢ Land grading, surveys, and soil testing (if required)  
‚Ä¢ Cleaning or demolishing any existing or unpermitted structures
‚Ä¢ Landscaping, fencing, driveways, patios, rain gutters
‚Ä¢ Utility connections (gas, water, electric) or fire sprinkler system installation
```

**Current Template (Incorrect):**
```
‚Ä¢ Furniture and personal belongings
‚Ä¢ Decorative items not specified  
‚Ä¢ Fencing modifications beyond immediate work area
‚Ä¢ Soil conditions requiring special treatment
‚Ä¢ HOA approval (client responsibility)
```

**ISSUE**: The current exclusions are generic and don't protect against the specific ADU construction cost overruns that the historical exclusions address.

#### 2. **ADDITIONAL SERVICES Section**
- **Historical**: Three specific upsell categories with detailed descriptions
- **Current**: **MISSING ENTIRELY** from current template
- **Revenue Impact**: Lost upselling opportunities worth thousands per project

#### 3. **Terms & Conditions**
- **Historical**: Specific construction contract language with 30-day validity and footnotes
- **Current**: Generic contract language without ADU-specific disclaimers
- **Legal Risk**: Missing proven legal protections
