# Railway Deployment Fix Summary

## Problem
- Vite preview command binds to localhost only
- Railway health checks fail because they can't reach localhost from outside container
- Command `vite preview --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080` still shows "Local: http://localhost:8080/"

## Solution
✅ **Express Server with 0.0.0.0 binding**

### Key Files Created:
1. **`server.js`** - Production Express server
2. **`nixpacks.toml`** - Railway build configuration  
3. **`scripts/test-production.sh`** - Deployment verification
4. **`DEPLOYMENT.md`** - Complete deployment guide

### Updated Scripts:
```json
{
  "start": "node server.js",
  "start:production": "NODE_ENV=production node server.js"
}
```

## Deployment Command
Railway now runs: `npm run build && npm run start:production`

## Health Check Endpoints
- `/health` - Detailed status
- `/healthz` - Simple Railway health check

## Expected Result
- ✅ Server binds to 0.0.0.0:8080 
- ✅ Railway health checks pass
- ✅ Static files served from dist/
- ✅ SPA routing works
- ✅ Production ready

## Test Commands
```bash
# Local test
npm run build && npm run start:production

# Production test  
curl https://anchor-builders-adu-generator-production.up.railway.app/health

# Full test suite
./scripts/test-production.sh both
```

This replaces the broken `vite preview` approach with a proper production server.
